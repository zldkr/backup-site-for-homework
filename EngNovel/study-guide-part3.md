# Summary of Chapters 12-17
Back in the woods, Percy, Annabeth, and Grover rest for the night while Percy learns that in order to earn his searcher’s license, Grover must find Pan, the god of wild places. To the satyrs, Pan is their master who once protected the earth. Although legend says that he died, the satyrs refuse to believe he is gone and many dedicate their lives to finding him, although none have survived the search. Grover says that despite the risk, he still desperately wants to search for Pan to restore the earth’s goodness. 

On this part of the trip, Percy also discovers that Grover was the keeper for Annabeth five years ago when he failed, but she forgave him. Grover stops Percy from asking more questions about that quest and instead says how he and Annabeth think this quest is different because the monsters seem to be holding back from attacking them while they look for something. The next morning, Percy meets Gladiola, a missing pink poodle. They collect enough money to buy train tickets by returning Gladiola to his owner.

The Amtrak train takes Percy, Annabeth, and Grover to Denver. Percy tries to keep a low-profile after his image is plastered on the front page of newspapers as a wanted fugitive for the disappearance of his mother and for the flaming bus accident. While Percy takes a nap, he dreams of a dreary, scary pit and tries to barter to save his mother’s life. Later, Annabeth reveals that she ran away to Camp Half-Blood when she was seven after learning that her father never wanted her and resented her after he remarried. 

The three explore the top of the Gateway Arch during a layover in St. Louis. Percy waits at the top of the Arch with the other tourists while Annabeth and Grover take the remaining seats on the elevator back down. A fat woman and a Chihuahua confront Percy and reveal that they are monsters trying to hurt him. The woman is the Mother of Monsters, a reptile-looking creature named Echidna. The Chihuahua is actually Chimera, a rabid, fire-breathing, lion serpent. Chimera attacks Percy by plunging its serpent fangs into Percy’s leg and damaging the Arch with a ball of fire. Percy feels defeated after he loses Riptide trying to defend himself and the other tourists. Echidna taunts him, saying if he truly believed he were the son of Poseidon then he would jump into the water to save himself. Percy prays and jumps into the river. 

As Percy enters the water, he realizes he wasn’t hurt by the impact of the water or Chimera’s bite, but rather feels dry and can breathe underwater. As he looks around, he sees Riptide a few feet in front of him. A female spirit tells him that his father believes in him, he should go to Santa Monica before going to the Underworld, and to not trust gifts. Before she departs, the spirit reassures Percy that his mother’s fate is not hopeless. As the spirit disappears, Percy grabs Riptide and swims off to find Annabeth and Grover. 

Several news stations and police officers surround the area below the Arch, as they try to figure out what happened to it. Eyewitnesses tell them they saw a boy jump into the water. As ambulance technicians attend to the civilians on the roof, Percy finds his friends and tells them everything that happened. While they make plans to go to Santa Monica, they hear news reporters making the connection between the boy who jumped and the fugitive they have been reporting on. The three quickly dash toward the train station before anyone recognizes Percy and head to Denver.

In Denver, Percy, Annabeth, and Grover contact Chiron through Iris-messaging, the rainbow goddess who carries messages for the gods. Luke answers and is updated on all that has happened so far. Percy and Luke discuss the possibility of Hades stealing the master bolt during the winter solstice by using his Helm of Darkness. While eating at a diner, Ares, Clarisse’s dad and the god of war, joins the group and asks Percy to retrieve his shield, which he lost in the Tunnel of Love while at a waterpark with his girlfriend. In turn, Ares will disclose information about Percy’s mother and help the three continue west. 

After initial reluctance, Percy and his friends head to the waterpark. Percy discovers that Ares was dating Aphrodite, the goddess of love, despite Aphrodite’s marriage to Hephaestus, the blacksmith. Hephaestus is aware of his wife’s affair and always tries to embarrass her and Ares. While Grover stands guard, Percy and Annabeth are caught in a trap that was set by Hephaestus to catch his wife and Ares together. A camera emerges and spotlights shine down on Percy and Annabeth. A loudspeaker voice announces the beginning of a countdown until the broadcast goes live to Mount Olympus. Annabeth is concerned about looking like a fool before the gods until thousands of metal spiders emerge and begin to swarm toward them. Annabeth is paralyzed with terror. Percy moves her back to the boat and uses his connection with water to move the boat along and fight off the spiders. Before the boat crashes, the two of them jump and Grover grabs them by flying with his shoes and carries them to safety before dropping them along the way. They survive the fall and Percy vows to confront Ares on this assignment.

At the diner, Percy and his friends return the shield they recovered to Ares. He takes his shield and gives Percy a backpack with food and directs them to a truck that will take them to Los Angeles. Before leaving, Ares tells Percy that his mother is not actually dead, but rather a hostage in metamorphosis. Percy, Annabeth, and Grover join some caged animals on the truck headed to Los Angeles with a stop in Las Vegas. While on the road, Percy learns that Grover was the keeper for Thalia, Zeus’ daughter who died. The two half-bloods she was protecting at the time were Annabeth and Luke. Annabeth shares how she tried to reconcile with her family a couple of years ago only to return to Camp Half-Blood. 

Percy dreams about the pit again. He hears a mysterious voice and sees his mother reaching out to him but wakes up to the truckers checking on the animals. After witnessing the abuse of some of the animals, Percy releases them into Vegas while he and his friends leave the truck. They enter the Lotus Hotel and Casino and are given a room key. They shower, eat, relax, and play video games until Percy realizes something seems off. People appear to be in a daze. No one can tell him what year they are in. Percy snaps Annabeth and Grover out of the trance they are in and they leave the hotel only to realize that since they lost track of time, they only have one day left to complete the quest.

While on the taxi ride to Santa Monica, Percy tries to explain his dream of the pit, but Annabeth reassures him that Hades has the master bolt and there is nothing else to fear. At the beach, Percy submerges into the water and is greeted by Nereid, the spirit of the sea. Nereid gives Percy three pearls and tells him to trust his heart on when to use them. She reminds him that if something belongs to the sea, it will eventually return. Percy meets with Annabeth and Grover on land and they search for the entrance to the Underworld. 

Down an alley, a group of boys start a fight, so the three flee into a waterbed store. They are welcomed by a salesclerk who calls himself Crusty. He prompts them to lie down and relax. When Annabeth and Grover take him up on it, ropes suddenly trap them to the beds. Crusty reveals himself to be Procrustes, the Stretcher, and attempts to attack Percy. However, Percy distracts Crusty by pretending he is interested in the waterbed. He persuades Crusty to demonstrate, which allows him the opportunity to trap Crusty with the ropes and use Riptide on him. Percy frees Annabeth and Grover from being stretched. Percy sees a flyer on a bulletin board for the DOA Recording Studio showing the exact address for the Underworld entrance.
