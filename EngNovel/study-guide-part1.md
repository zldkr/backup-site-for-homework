# Summary of Chapters 1-6
Percy Jackson is a troubled kid. He is 12, a boarding student at a poor school <u>Yancy Academy<u>. They're going to do a field trip. But Percy knows he is always in trouble. And that's the reason why he gets probation. He has dyslexia and attention deficit disorder so his grades are always bad. And this means he can't learn all those names and facts as well as spell them correctly. He realizes a huge storm is brewing. He pushes Nancy Bobofit into the water and is warned by Mrs. Dodds that sooner or later he will be found. What is strange is that Mrs. Dodds turns into a shriveled hag. Mrs. Dodds lunges at him who swing the sword and Mrs. Dodds crumble. Since then, the students haven't heard of her. Gradually he's used to the occational hallucination. He knows something must have been erased. The weather is freak and storm ruin many airplanes. He became cranky and irritable, and his grades drop to Fs. Finally he insults his English teacher that makes him booted out from Yancy Academy.
