# Summary of Chapters 1-6
Percy Jackson is a troubled kid. He is 12, a boarding student at a poor school Yancy Academy. They're going to do a field trip. But Percy knows he is always in trouble. And that's the reason why he gets probation. He has dyslexia and attention deficit disorder so his grades are always bad. And this means he can't learn all those names and facts as well as spell them correctly. He realizes a huge storm is brewing. He pushes Nancy Bobofit into the water and is warned by Mrs. Dodds that sooner or later he will be found. What is strange is that Mrs. Dodds is not a human. Mrs. Dodds lunged at him who swing the sword.
