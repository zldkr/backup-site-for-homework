# Summary of Chapters 18-22
Annabeth, Percy, and Grover arrive at the recording studio, and meet a security guard named Charon who asks them to pay for their entrance. Percy gives him some drachmas he stole from Crusty’s office before they left. Charon is not happy with the amount and will not allow them to enter. After Charon recognizes Percy is a godling, Percy hands him a bag full of drachmas and says that he will put in a good word with Hades about giving Charon a proper raise. Charon agrees and the group departs toward one of three entrances with metal detectors and security cameras. 

Before passing through the security line, the three are stopped by Cerberus, a three-headed security Rottweiler. Percy tries to distract him with a bedpost he took from Crusty’s, but Cerberus is not interested in “the stick.” Annabeth pulls out a ball she took from the waterpark and commands Cerberus to sit. Percy and Grover are able to sneak past the dog while Annabeth distracts him. She tosses him the ball and catches up with Grover and Percy. They set off the metal detectors with their magical items and run to escape the security guards.

As Percy, Annabeth, and Grover head toward the house of Hades, the flying shoes Grover is wearing take off and fly him toward the pit from Percy’s dream. The shoes fall off of Grover before he falls into the pit as Percy and Annabeth catch up. When they sit down to catch their breath, Percy notices that his backpack feels heavier. A whisper echoes from the pit signifying the entrance to the stormy pit of Tartarus and the three flee before they are sucked down. 

Finally, they meet Hades who accuses Percy of stealing not only the master sword, but also his Helm of Darkness. Hades claims he does not want war because he would have to hire more staff to support the extra deaths. Percy denies stealing either item, but Hades warns him that he will unleash the dead back into the world if his helm is not returned. Hades tells Percy to check his backpack. Percy opens it and reveals the master sword in his possession. Percy feels defeated, knowing that someone has been manipulating him. Hades says he knows that Percy came to bargain for his mother’s life. He then shows Percy a vision of his mother in a ball of gold fire. 

Hades threatens to kill Percy’s mother if he does not return his helm. Percy grabs the pearls to leave Hades, but realizes he only has three and cannot save himself, his friends, and his mother. He gives up the idea of a joyful reunion with his mother and uses the pearls to escape with Annabeth and Grover in order to return the master bolt to Olympus. The three are dropped into the ocean at Santa Monica and plan to not only return the master’s bolt, but also to talk with the god who tricked them.

On the shore, Percy, Annabeth, and Grover confront Ares about stealing the master bolt and the Helm of Darkness. Ares admits that while he did not personally steal them, since gods cannot steal each other’s symbols of power, he did have someone else take it. Ares wants war, so he framed Percy as the culprit in order to achieve a three-way war against Poseidon, Zeus, and Hades. He explains that magic similar to that in Riptide, the sword, was used on the backpack, so that the bolt would appear in the backpack once Percy entered the Underworld. Since Percy still has the master bolt, Ares says he will have to kill Percy so that it cannot be returned to Zeus. 

Percy and Ares make a deal that they will fight and if Percy wins, he will return the bolt and be free from Ares; however, if he loses, Ares can take the bolt and transform Percy into anything Ares wishes. The two engage in battle but are interrupted by mortals who recognize Percy as the boy from the news. Ares fires at the mortals while Percy uses the waves against him and stabs him in the heel. As Ares prepares to implement his next attack, a strange force stops him and he lowers his sword in defeat. He tells Percy to watch out because he’s made a new enemy, then disappears in a bright light. 

The Furies appear next and take the Helm of Darkness to return to Hades after they acknowledge that Percy did not steal it. As they fly away, Percy joins Grover and Annabeth and they briefly ponder who or what stopped Ares from continuing the fight. The three decide the fastest way to get to New York to return the bolt is by flying in an airplane, despite Percy’s fear of Zeus’s wrath.

In Manhattan, Percy separates from Annabeth and Grover so he can return the master bolt to Zeus while Annabeth and Grover go back to Camp Half-Blood to tell Chiron everything that has happened. At Olympus, Percy delivers the master bolt to Zeus and Poseidon and discloses details of his quest. He tells them about the fight with Ares as well as the unease he encountered while at the entrance of Tartarus. Zeus dismisses Percy’s concerns and spares his life since he returned the bolt. Poseidon reassures Percy that he claims him as his son and tells Percy that he will have a decision to make regarding a delivered package when he returns home. At this time, Percy also learns that his mother was returned home after Hades received his Helm. 

Back home, Percy reunites with his mother and Smelly Gabe. Smelly Gabe blames him for his destroyed car and says he is not welcome there. He raises his hand to hit Sally when she tries to defend Percy. Sally and Percy retreat upstairs to his bedroom where Percy finds the package containing Medusa’s head. He suggests that Sally use the head against Smelly Gabe. Percy decides to leave for Camp Half-Blood and says goodbye to his mother.

Percy returns to Camp Half-Blood and is welcomed with praise and celebratory gifts. In a letter, his mother tells him that Smelly Gabe mysteriously disappeared and she has received a nice commission on her sculpture. She used the money to buy a new apartment, enroll at NYU, and hold a spot at a private school in New York for him. With that information, Percy realizes he has to decide if he wants to stay at Camp Half-Blood year-round or return home during the school year. Later that evening, Grover says goodbye to Annabeth and Percy as he departs on his search for Pan. 

To clear his head and decide what to do in the fall, Percy begins sword training. He sees Luke fighting dummies with a new sword named Backbiter, a two-sided sword that can kill mortal and creature. The two boys sit by a tree to talk and Percy gets the impression that Luke is getting ready to say goodbye. Suddenly, Luke snaps his fingers and a scorpion the size of Percy’s hand appears from the pit. Luke points out that these scorpions can jump fifteen feet and the stinger can slice through clothes to kill someone in sixty seconds. 

During their conversation, Percy realizes that Luke is the missing piece from his prophesy: the betrayal of a friend. Luke felt deceived by the gods for sending him on a pity quest—one that had already been previously fulfilled by Hercules. He was frustrated with the gods for repeating the same quests when there was so much more out there, so he began to listen to urgings from Kronos and stole the bolt and the helm during the winter solstice. When caught by Ares, Luke convinced him that hiding the items would result in a war between the gods. At this point, Luke admits to summoning the hellhound to attack Percy in order to instill fear in the camp and propel Percy’s quest. He also admits that part of his plan failed when Percy gave the gifted shoes to Grover. The shoes were cursed and were supposed to drag Percy and the bolt into Tartarus. 

Luke declares that Kronos will rise and that the Olympians will be overthrown. Then he disappears while Percy tries to fight off the scorpion. Percy slices the scorpion but not before he is stung with poison. Although Percy tries to heal himself with the creek water, he is saved by Chiron’s magical nectar. He then tells Annabeth and Chiron about Luke’s deception and vows to take revenge. However, Chiron redirects Percy by pointing out that he will get his justice when the time is right. Annabeth has reconciled with her family and they arrive to take her home. Percy decides to go home as well and plans to fight Luke next summer. 


# Open-ended Questions
## Question 1
Neither god can believe Ares would do such a thing, but Percy tells him he did not act alone. He explains about his dreams and about the powerful creature in the pit that felt older than even the gods. Zeus grudgingly thanks Percy for his work and disappears, leaving Percy with his father. Poseidon explains that in the pit is Kronos, king of the Titans and Poseidon and Zeus's father, and tells the story of how Zeus cut Kronos into a thousand pieces and banished him to the pit of Tartarus. Percy insists that Kronos intends to rise from the pit and come back to power. Poseidon then tells Percy he must go, but reveals that his mother has been returned, since he returned the helm to Hades. As Percy leaves, Poseidon tells him that he will soon have to make an important choice, and that he is proud of him.

### Prophecy
The First Great Prophecy was a prophecy given by the Oracle over seventy years ago. Around World War II, when the sons of Zeus (America), Poseidon (Great Britain and the Soviet Union), and Hades (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan) fought each other, the Oracle foretold of a future event that would end their affairs with mortal women for the next seventy years. The prophecy is revealed in The Last Olympian, and is written in iambic tetrameter:

1.A half-blood of the eldest gods

2.Shall reach sixteen against all odds

3.And see the world in endless sleep

4.The hero's soul, cursed blade shall reap

5.A single choice shall end his days

6.Olympus to preserve or raze


The three demigods who fulfilled the prophecy: Percy, Annabeth, and Luke.

### Unraveling the Prophecy
Percy was a half-blood child of Poseidon , one of the eldest gods (Poseidon, Zeus and Hades), otherwise known as the Big Three.

Percy reaches sixteen despite all of the numerous times he was almost killed by Luke, Kronos and his monsters.

Percy finds the whole city of Manhattan asleep from Olympus so the war can go on without any of the humans interfering.

When Luke and Annabeth first met, he handed her a knife with the promise that they would always be a family and be there for each other. However, when Luke betrayed the camp and the Olympians, the broken promise cursed Annabeth's knife. The blade was then used by Luke to kill himself, effectively killing Kronos.

Percy had to choose between giving Annabeth's knife to Luke and allow him to destroy himself, or trying to destroy Luke himself and failing, causing Kronos to burn away Luke's body as he took on his true form. Either choice would have caused Luke to die. 

Percy's choice would result in the destruction of Olympus or preserving Olympus the way it is.


## Question 2
When the novel begins, Percy knows little about his identity, his past, and his family. Even when he first learns he is a half-blood, he has trouble accepting this and feels like he has a foot in two worlds.

He discovers that he's a skilled swordsman with Riptide, a sword that Poseidon left for him, and he begins to rethink his thoughts on Poseidon. While Percy continues to feel abandoned by Poseidon and to focus more on rescuing Mom from the Underworld, Percy gradually becomes more accepting of his dad.

Revelation, transformation, and atonement are the most essential factors of the hero’s journey. The revelation is a sudden realization the hero has about himself and his view of the world. Transformation deals with life and death, the moment a part of the hero dies so another part can be born. Atonement is essential since it describes when a hero is at one with himself/herself. Once Percy realizes that Ares has tricked him by giving him the bag which had the bolt, he is transformed. He challenged him to a battle and used all of the strength he acquired throughout his journey. He gained mastery of the abilities given to him by his father and managed to defeat a god, which definitely wasn’t an easy task. At the moment of Percy meeting his father after the battle, Percy realized just what it means to be a half-blood, and accepted who he really was. He embraced his own identity and didn’t doubt any of it.

Percy’s transformation into a hero perfectly embodies Campbell’s “hero’s journey.”

## Question 3
In general, there are numerous characteristics that a hero must hold like courage, bravery, mental fortitude, strength, intelligence, patience, selflessness and honesty.

A hero is a man who is brave in the toughest of situations, and stands up for what is right.

Wisdom is also required. Percy must outwit the giant, Procrustes (Crusty) in order to save himself and his friends.

Percy also showed is selflessness in the story. He cares more about the wants and needs of the people around him then his own. Percy Jackson has even saved the world twice, by leading armies he organised on his own.

## Question 4
Love and loyalty, falling into Tartaraus for someone, taking a knife for someone. Doing these things for people you care about is beyond amazing.

You don't need powers to be amazing, Annabeth Chase can't fly, can't charmspeak, can't control water. But she can think and with that alone she found the Athena Parthenos and she was the reason the second war was won.

good and bad, no one is just evil or pure, people have layers and you shouldn't stereotype them like that. Just look at Luke. 

These reason is what I learned from _Percy Jackson_
1. Always have more than one plan.

2. Never give up, even if the road ahead seems dark and the future seems bleak. When push comes to shove, we can be heroes.

3. Trust your friends and be loyal.

4. Just because things aren’t perfect doesn’t mean they can’t be fixed.

5. Even heroes drool in their sleep.

6. There is magic in the world, and it’s a lot closer than you think.

7. Carry yourself with confidence. You might feel like you don't fit in, but you always find the right people to hang out with.

8. Expect the unexpected.

9. Don’t butt heads with people you don’t know.

10. Everyone has a hero in them. They just have to find it. We don't need to be a Demigod to make a difference.

11. Sometimes, our greatest flaws are our greatest strengths. 

12. Diversity is at the root of empathy.


# Detailed Questions
## Question 1
As the spirit disappears, Percy grabs Riptide and swims off to find Annabeth and Grover. 

Annabeth and Grover get tied up in two of Crusty's bed, but Percy is able to save them by outsmarting Crusty. He asks Crusty to try a bed for him, and then he lops off Crusty's head. Crusty is the last big obstacle that Percy and his friends must face before entering the Underworld.

## Question 2
How does Percy convince the guard at the Empire State Building to let him see Zeus? He showed the guard the lightning bolt.

## Question 3
Hades tells him that he doesn't want war – he can't afford to have a huge surge in dead people. The Underworld is already way too full of dead people. And they're sucking his wealth dry. Hades accuses Percy of stealing the master bolt himself in order to help Poseidon start a war.
