# Summary of Chapters 7-11
Percy feels overwhelmed by his new home and everything he is learning as he continues to wonder who his father is. Annabeth tells him that although he may never know, it is important that he remain at the camp in order to protect himself from monsters and mortals. The camp’s border does not allow monsters or mortals to enter unless summoned by someone within the camp. If he were to stay in the mortal world, he would be more susceptible to danger. Annabeth explains that Percy is only allowed to leave the camp with permission or if assigned to a quest. 

Percy asks Annabeth what she knows about the summer solstice. She only recalls an unease with the weather after her trip to Mount Olympus for the winter solstice with Clarisse and Luke. She also overheard talk about something that was stolen and if the item was not returned by the summer solstice, a war would break out. Percy and Annabeth return to their cabins where Percy chats with Luke. Luke tells Percy that although Annabeth desperately wants to go on a quest, she is unable to until somebody special arrives. Percy does not understand what Luke means but drops the conversation.

As Percy settles into the camp, he discovers his skill in sword fighting, his gift with water, and his father’s identity. During a sword-fighting lesson with Luke, Percy successfully beats him, which catches Luke off guard. Later, Percy asks Grover about Grover’s desire for a searcher’s license. Grover does not share much detail other than how he may be one step closer if he successfully protects Percy during a quest. They also talk about the “Big Three” gods: Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. 

Grover explains that the children of the “Big Three” gods are more powerful than other half-bloods. Because of this, the “Big Three” decided not to have any more children after they recognized that their children were causing catastrophic events. Zeus, however, broke this pact by having a daughter named Thalia. Hades was angered at Zeus for his indiscretion and sent monsters to attack Thalia. She sacrificed herself by fighting the monsters alone to save other half-bloods and a satyr who were accompanying her on their way to Camp Half-Blood. As Thalia was dying, Zeus turned her into a pine tree. Through this tree, now called Half-Blood Hill for her heroic act, Thalia’s spirit still protects the surrounding borders. 

In the evening, during a game of capture the flag, Percy is attacked by Clarisse and several other campers, leaving a deep wound in his arm. Percy falls back into a creek and, even though he is weak, he is mysteriously able to defend himself against his opponents. Meanwhile, Luke wins the game for his cabin. Annabeth magically appears near Percy in the creek after taking off her invisibility cap. As they are getting out of the water, Annabeth notices that Percy’s arm has already healed. Suddenly, a hellhound from the Fields of Punishment attacks Percy, but is promptly killed by arrows fired by Chiron, piercing its neck. Chiron trots over and points out that someone from inside the camp must have summoned a monster to attack Percy. As Percy resubmerges into the water to heal, a hologram of green light shines above him and reveals that Poseidon has claimed Percy as his son. 

The camp responds to Poseidon’s claim by granting Percy his own private cabin as well as other freedoms, while also assigning him to a world-saving quest. Despite these luxuries of freedom, Percy feels isolated and angered after hearing he is being blamed for his mother’s disappearance back home. That night, Grover encourages Percy to talk with Chiron about accepting the quest and speaking with the Oracle about his destiny. Percy agrees to the quest and Chiron explains why Zeus and Poseidon are fighting. Zeus believes that Poseidon stole his lightning bolt, the symbol of his power. Poseidon denies this allegation and seeks an apology by the summer solstice, the day Zeus also wants his master bolt returned by. If the quest fails, a catastrophic war will be unleashed. Zeus thinks that having Poseidon’s son return his bolt will be a rewarding peace offering. Percy seeks advice from the Oracle and learns that he has to go west and face a god to find the stolen item. The Oracle tells him that along the way, he will be betrayed by a friend and fail to save what matters most. 

Chiron tells Percy that he suspects that Hades stole the master bolt because he was angry that Zeus broke their pact by having another child. He knew that Zeus would blame Poseidon and a war would unfold. Chiron believes Hades also knew Poseidon would claim Percy as his son, so Hades has tried to kill Percy by sending monsters such as the Minotaur before Percy’s quest could begin. Percy is angry that Hades’ desire to kill him caused his mother to disappear and has instilled fear in the rest of the camp. He takes Grover and Annabeth on the journey, so that Grover can get his searcher’s license and Annabeth can fulfill her desire for a quest.

As Percy, Grover, and Annabeth prepare to depart for their quest, Luke gives Percy magical shoes that fly. As a precaution, Percy hands the shoes over to Grover because Percy fears that Zeus will strike him down if he travels through the sky. Chiron gives Percy the ballpoint pen that transforms into a sword, named Riptide. The sword cannot be lost. It cannot hurt any mortal, only monsters, but Percy is reminded that he is susceptible to both mortal and celestial weapons. 

Once in the city, Percy starts thinking about his family. Grover shares with Percy how his mother was protecting him by staying with Smelly Gabe because his scent masked Percy’s scent from monsters. While they are on a bus headed toward the entrance to the Underworld, three old women who look like Mrs. Dodds get on the bus. These women are actually monsters. They are called the Furies. Percy wears Annabeth’s invisible cap and slips past them, hoping that the Furies only want him and will ignore his friends. Instead, the Furies attack Annabeth and Grover. 

While still invisible, Percy spins the bus by taking control of the steering wheel. He pulls the emergency brake and releases the mortals from the bus. Then he takes off the cap and instigates a fight with the monsters, so they will leave his friends alone. Annabeth and Grover help hold the Furies while Percy uses Riptide to turn the first two to dust. As Percy strikes the third Fury, he and his friends escape from the bus just as it bursts into flames. The Mrs. Dodds look-alike calls for reinforcements amidst the flames and the three friends flee into the nearby woods.

Percy, Annabeth, and Grover emerge from the woods and come upon a curio shop that smells like food. As they stop to eat, Grover notices a life-size statue outside that looks strangely like his Uncle Ferdinand. A woman who calls herself Aunty Em feeds them and offers to take their picture. Percy accepts the offer, but Annabeth and Grover are skeptical about the woman’s statues. Suddenly, Grover realizes that the statue was his uncle and Annabeth warns Percy and Grover to look away from the woman. Percy learns that Aunty Em is actually Medusa, a monster seeking revenge on Annabeth for being the daughter of Athena, the god who cursed her. She tells Percy that he would be better off as a statue than having to play the Olympians’ game. 

Grover attacks Medusa with a tree branch with his eyes shut while Percy uses the reflection of a gazing ball to approach her. Percy severs Medusa’s head with Riptide. Annabeth says that even though the head is a spoil of war it can still turn him to stone. Tired of being used as a pawn, Percy steals money from Medusa’s office to use on their journey. He grabs a freight bill showing the Underworld’s billing address and now knows it is located at a DOA Recording Studio in California He finds a box and fills out a delivery slip to send Medusa’s head to Mount Olympus before they plan their next move. 


# Detailed Questions
## Question 1
Percy defeats the Minotaur mere hours after he learns of his godly birth, which shows that he is at least the son of a powerful god, perhaps Ares or even one of the Big Three. 

More importantly, the Minotaur’s original slayer, Theseus, was a son of Poseidon. It also happens to rain during the battle, perhaps giving Percy more strength to defeat the beast.

Percy is average/good at most camp activities (he later became extremely proficient at swordsmanship, but that was due to diligent practicing), except had a natural talent for canoeing.

Later on, Percy sprays a camp bully (Clarisse) and several other children of Ares with toilet water, earning him the nickname “Supreme Lord of the Bathroom”. This shows his early discovery of being able to manipulate water.

He resembles his father. Frankly, they share the same dark hair and green eyes. Poseidon, like other gods (besides Aphrodite), has a consistent appearance.

## Question 2
They worried that something has been stolen from Olympus and needs to be returned by the Summer Solstice.

## Question 3
Medusa. Medusa disguises herself as Aunty Em, who owns a roadside curio-shop ("Auntie Em's Garden Gnome Emporium") in the middle of the woods in New York. Percy, Grover, and Annabeth don't recognize her at first because she is completely veiled.


# Open-ended Questions
## Question 1
Medusa wants to turn Annabeth into a statue and destroy her, because she is a daughter of Athena. This way, she hopes to take revenge on Athena.

As Athena was the one responsible for Medusa's situation and Medusa hates her and all her children for it. During the fight, Medusa says that she wants Annabeth to suffer for Athena's actions. The safest way to kill Medusa is to chop off her head, but as Annabeth's only weapon was a knife, she didn't really have good odds for it to work.

## Question 2
Grover Underwood mentions the war to Percy Jackson as one of the reasons the Big Three (Zeus, Poseidon, Hades) agreed to not have anymore demigod children. 

I think it is imaginative, and the writer use his imagination vividly to narrate the history  and his story of WW2. 

( The novel wrote:
>World War II, you know, that was basically a fight between the sons of Zeus and Poseidon on one side, and the sons of Hades on the other. The winning side, Zeus and Poseidon, made Hades swear an oath with them: no more affairs with mortal women. They all swore on the River Styx. 

## Question 3
He shall go west, and faces the god who has turned. In addition, he shall find what was stolen, and see it safely returned. Besides, he shall be betrayed by one who calls you a friend. What's more, he shall fail to save what matters most, in the end.

Percy is left with tons of questions. What friend? What matters most? So he interupted:
>“Wait! What do you mean? What friend? What will I fail to save?”
